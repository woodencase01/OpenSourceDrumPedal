## New challenges
* Vertical frame bends **even more than before** with the feet weight
* Assembly with the single part housing is challenging, and requires a lot of manual fixing after the printing
* 1/8" Acrylic feels weak for the board
* Spring tension is hard to adjust from the back of the vertical housing

## Unresolved
* There is a **still** lot of plastic needed, and the printing time is quite high.

## Resolved
* ~~Poor clearance for the feet.~~
* ~~Poor lateral stability.~~
